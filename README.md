## files to work with code
Name of the file| File content
----------------|----------------------
index.html      | Here you can see the HTML
common.js       | And here you can see the JS code
main.min.css    | Unfortunately, you can't see the main css, but of course you can use your browser inspector. I just write on SASS instead of css.
